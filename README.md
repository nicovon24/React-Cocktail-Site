# React-Cocktail-Site
React JS project made with a bar API I found on the internet.

Hi! I have created this project, about a cocktail bar using React JS, pure CSS and an API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=). 
I have used also tools such as React hooks, React router and font-awesome.
If you want to try the code in your pc, you need in the app file, do: npm install, npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core, npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome.
